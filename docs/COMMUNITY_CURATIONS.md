Community Curations
===================

If you want to have DIM automatically look for specific drops (and share your list of ideal drops), this will let you do just that.

To build a list of your own, go to [Banshee-44.com](https://banshee-44.com/) - it lets you look for items and select the perks that you're looking for. Once you find an item that you like, copy the URL that it generates into a text file. Keep looking and finding those items that you're hunting for and paste them into that file, separating each with a new line.

Once you've got your list put together, load it up (in the rating/review menu) and look for the green thumbs (or search with `is:curated`). If you click on the item, it will tell you what perks the curator picked out.

Feel free to share your curated lists with your fireteam, the raid you're sherpa-ing, your gambit buddies, people in your crucible sweats... you get the idea.
