Community Curations (Wish Lists)
================================

If you've ever wanted to have DIM automatically look for specific drops (or share your list of ideal drops with other folks), this will let you do just that.

To build a list of your own, go to [Banshee-44.com](https://banshee-44.com/) - it lets you look for items and select the perks that you're looking for. Once you find an item that you like, copy the URL that it generates into a text file. Keep looking and finding those items that you're hunting for and paste them into that file, separating each with a new line.

If there's a few rolls of that Better Devils that you've got your eye on, feel free to put bunches of them in your file. We'll match the first of them that we can find. If you want one Better Devils roll for PvE and another for PvP, put one in a file for PvE items and the other in a file for PvP items and load them one at a time.

Once you've got your list put together, load it up (in the rating/review menu) and look for the green thumbs (or search with `is:wishlist` or `is:curated`). If you click on the item, it will tell you what perks the curator picked out.

Feel free to share your curated lists with your fireteam, the raid you're sherpa-ing, your gambit buddies, people in your crucible sweats... you get the idea.

## Linking To Banshee-44 from DIM

If you have a roll in your inventory that you'd like to add to your wish list to share, you can do it from inside of DIM. Find your item, make sure you have the perks you think are important selected (this is important!) and click the little gift icon on the top right hand corner of the item's pop-up. It'll bring you to banshee-44 to double-check if you want, or just copy and paste it into your file.

## Comments

If you want to add comments in your text file on separate lines, go ahead! We'll ignore any line that isn't a link to banshee-44, so you can put notes for which item+roll you're talking about.
